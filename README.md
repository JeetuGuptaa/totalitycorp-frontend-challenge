# React + Vite
**To run this small project:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies:

npm install


3. Start the development server:

npm run dev


Now, you can open the application in your browser at http://localhost:5173.


Product data is fetched from Dummy JSON: https://dummyjson.com/products, a fake REST API that provides dummy data for development.


Only React is used

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
